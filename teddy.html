        <h1>My Beautiful Lifelong Teddy 🧸</h1>
        <p>
            If love had a shape, it would be a teddy bear like soft, warm, and always ready to cuddle you🧸. <br>
            Just like a teddy, you bring comfort and happiness into my life every single day🧸.  <br>
            Every time I hug you, I feel like I’m holding my own little piece of paradise🧸.  <br><br><br>

            I love the way we hug, wrapped in each other's arms like a teddy bear hug that never ends🧸.  <br>
            The warmth of your soul feels safer than anything in this world, like my own cozy little world in your arms🧸.  <br>
            Your hugs feel like a teddy’s soft fur which is gentle, loving, and impossible to let go of🧸.  <br><br><br>

            Just like a teddy stays with its owner, I want to stay by your side forever, through every laugh, every tear, and every beautiful moment we share🧸.  <br>
            When you rest your head on my shoulder, I feel like the luckiest person alive, holding my sweetest teddy close to my heart🧸.  <br>
            When we play around like little kids, teasing each other, laughing, and stealing small kisses, my heart feels full of joy🧸.  <br><br><br>

            Sitting beside you, feeling your warmth, is the most peaceful thing in the world like cuddling my favorite teddy that brings sweet dreams🧸.  <br>
            When you wake up next to me(morning call), your sleepy smile is the most adorable thing, just like a teddy bear that has come to life to make my mornings brighter🧸.  <br><br><br>

            I wish I could hold you like my teddy all day long, never letting go, always feeling the softness of your love around me🧸.  <br>
            Your love is like a teddy bear which is always there to comfort me, always there to make me smile, and always the softest part of my life🧸. <br>
            On cold days, your warmth is my favorite blanket, and on lonely nights, your voice is the sweetest lullaby🧸.  <br><br><br>

            No matter where I am, no matter how far, I always carry the feeling of your hugs with me, like a teddy bear which is close to my heart🧸.  <br>
            You are my real life teddy which is always my safe place, my happiness, my forever cuddle buddy🧸.  <br><br><br>

            Happy Teddy Day, my love🧸 <br>
            Today, I am giving you a teddy(Suppose i give you), but no teddy will ever be as precious as you are to me🧸.  <br><br>
